# AQI_Data_Analysis

## Project Overview
Air pollution and AQI levels have become a serious concern today, impacting public health and environmental safety.  
This project analyzes air quality data to identify pollution trends, handle missing values and outliers, and present actionable insights through visuals.

## Problem Statement
To analyze air pollution data, clean inconsistencies, handle outliers, and visualize AQI trends to support data-driven environmental decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Tasks Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Missing value treatment using median
- Outlier handling using IQR method
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- AQI trend and pollutant-wise analysis


## Key Insight
PM2.5 and PM10 consistently showed higher variability and extreme values compared to other pollutants, indicating major contributors to poor air quality.

## Business Impact
- Helps environmental authorities identify critical pollutants
- Supports data-driven decision-making for pollution control
- Provides clear visualization for non-technical stakeholders

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → Raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/` → Python analysis notebook
